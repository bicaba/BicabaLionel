# **Audio amplifier** üîä
Sometimes the sound from my laptop is not powerful enough when I'm watching videos or listening to music, so I often have to use my headphones. In my Circuit Theory 2 class, we learned how op-amps work, and I want to apply that knowledge to this project. My goal is to build an audio amplifier to use with my laptop, so I don't always have to rely on my headphones. Additionally, I'm planning to build an AM radio for a future project, and I intend to use this audio amplifier for that as wellüòä.

  üìå Audio Amplifier Specification:
   
   
1. Volume Control:

  - The audio amplifier should include a feature to control the volume.
    Volume control should allow for precise adjustment to achieve the desired audio level.
  - The volume control mechanism can be in the form of a rotary knob, slider,     or digital interface.

2. Tone Adjustment:

  - The audio amplifier should have the capability to adjust the tone of the   audio output.

 - These controls can be in the form of rotary knobs, sliders, or digital interfaces to allow for fine-tuning of the audio output to suit user preferences.
 
 

##  Op amp principle ü§î
An op amp (Operationnel amplifer ) is an intagrated circuit (IC) that amplifies the difference in voltage between two inputs( the Inverting input and the Non-inverting input).
- The currents into the inverting input and non-inverting input of an ideal op amp amplifier are zero and the volatage node at the input nodes of an ideals op amp are equal.
- Op amp are used to build circuits that perform mathematical operations. Many of the theses circuits habe been given names. The inverting amplifiers, the non-inverting amplifier, voltage followers are some example of useful op amp circuit.

   - Inverting amplifiers : Gain = V_Output/V_input = -R1/R2

   - Non-inverting amplifiers : Gain = V_Output/V_input = 1+ ( R1/R2)
   - Voltage followers : Gain = 1

fig 1: the **ŒºA741** is an example of op amp 

####  quick Demonstration of how an op amp work : 

I will built a Non-inverting amplifer using the ŒºA741 for the demonstration
- Simulation on **Multisim** :

fig 4: Waveform of the circuit. Green= V_input(input voltage) and CH3 = V_output (Output voltage ) Gain = 11.2/2.82 = 3.97

- Test of the circuit

*fig 5: Yellow for input voltage(2.09 V) and Green for Output voltage(8.4 V)* 

The gain is calculated as follows: 
 Gain = 8.4/2.09=4 

As observed, the gain obtained from the **Multisim** simulation is very close to the one measured during the test. This indicates that the input voltage is amplified approximately 4 times at the output of the operational amplifier.


## OP amp IC
the Op amp IC being used in this project is the **LM386** 

- This chip is a powrful amplifers designed for use in low volatage consumer application

- We have a voltage gains from 20 to 200
- the minimum  supply voltage is 4 V and the maximum voltage is 12 V

## LTspice simulation 

I used  **LTspice** to build and simulate my audio amplifier circuit with a music waveform file. I then export the amplified music at the output.
